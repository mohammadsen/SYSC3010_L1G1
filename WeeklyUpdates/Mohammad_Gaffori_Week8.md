3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** 
   - This week, I continued to spend a lot of timing trying to get Alexa to run on the Raspberry Pi. 
      I had issues with the Alexa Console online. The code that is used to create the Custom alexa commands uses NodeJs version 8 while the Firebase now uses version 9. 
      I was unable to get the custom commands to work and had my account locked out. After MANY hours of diagnosing, I was finally able to get it to work.
   - We worked together to demonstrate our end to end, and also the technical report
